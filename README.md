# msa-instagram

Simplified clone of Instagram back-end system in both monolith/ version and microservices architecture(MSA) version(
msa/).  

Every server application is implemented with Spring Boot as a framework and Kotlin as a language.  

Different skills(or libraries) are used in each application(e.g. some of them use Spring Webflux and the others
Spring MVC).

(TODO: Add system diagrams for each monolith and MSA generated with PlantUML)
