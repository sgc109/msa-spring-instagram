# msa-spring-instagram

Simplified clone of Instagram back-end system in both monolith version and microservices architecture(MSA) version(
msa).

Every server application is implemented with Spring Boot as a framework and Kotlin as a language.

Different skills(or libraries) are used in each application(e.g. some of them use Spring Webflux and the others
Spring MVC).

(TODO: Add system diagrams for each monolith and MSA generated with PlantUML)

## APIs
